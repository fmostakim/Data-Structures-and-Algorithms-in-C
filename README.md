# Data Structures and Algorithms in C 🚀

Welcome to my DSA repository! Here, I document my journey of learning and implementing core Data Structures and Algorithms using the **C programming language**.

## 📌 What's Inside?
This repository contains clean and efficient code for various computer science concepts, including:

- **Sorting Algorithms:** Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms:** Linear Search, Binary Search.
- **Recursion:** Factorial, Fibonacci, GCD, and other recursive problems.
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues (Implementing soon).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** C
- **Compiler:** GCC (MinGW)
- **Focus:** Logic building, Time Complexity analysis, and Memory Management.

## 📂 Structure
Each algorithm is in its own folder/file with comments explaining the logic.

## 🌱 Future Goals
- Implement Trees and Graphs.
- Solve LeetCode problems in C.
